<h1 id="whytrumpjrmeetingwitharussianlawyerisnotconcerning">Why Trump JR meeting with a russian lawyer is not concerning</h3>

<p>Ok so, lets get this out of the way, what happened?<br> Basically while Trump was still runniung, Trump Jr went off to meet with a lawyer from russia. <br>Yeah? What is so wrong with that? Absolutly zero. </p>

<h2 id="whatisthemainstreammediaclaiming">What is the main stream media claiming?</h2>

<p>The msn is attemping to some how link this to their other theory "Russia helped and is linked to the Trump campain."<br> Well yes, he did meet with a lawyer that was russian, but had absolutly no connections to the russian goverment! <br>According to Business Insider, Natalia Veselnitskaya (the involved lawyer)<br> has a few clients, none of them being or linked to the goverment of russia. <br>This seems to be another way the media is trying to <br>push their agenda of Trump being a "xenophobic, transphobic, racist, sexist bigot"</p>

<h2 id="butwhywhywouldthemediawanttodothis">But why? Why would the media want to do this?</h2>

<p>Simple, the main stream media is liberal. The vast majority of the msn is infact liberal.<br> This is just adding to the huge bubble that tons of leftists are enclosed in. <br>These leftists then continue to say that people with right wing beliefs are in a bubble.<br> That message coming from the viewers of Msnbc is extremley ironic.</p>
